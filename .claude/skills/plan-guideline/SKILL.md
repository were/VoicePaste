# Make a Plan

This skill instructs AI agents on how to create comprehensive implementation plans
for new features, refactoring, or bug fixes. The plan should be thorough enough to
serve as a blueprint for implementation, with concrete file-level details and
quantified complexity estimates.

## Planning Philosophy

A good plan is:
- **Concrete**: Specifies exact files to modify/create, not vague "audit the codebase" steps
- **Quantified**: Uses lines of code instead of time estimates
- **Design-first TDD**: Follows strict ordering: Documentation → Tests → Implementation
- **Interface-driven**: Documents API/interface changes before implementation
- **Actionable**: Can be directly used to create a GitHub issue with `open-issue` skill
- **Bug-aware**: For bug fixes, includes reproduction attempts and observations before design

### Development Workflow Order

**CRITICAL**: All implementation plans **MUST** follow this strict ordering:

1. **Documentation first** - Update all relevant documentation and design documents
2. **Tests second** - Write or update test cases that verify the behavior
3. **Implementation last** - Write the actual implementation code

This design-first test-driven development (TDD) style ensures:
- Clear design before coding
- Testable requirements
- No implementation without tests
- Living documentation that stays in sync

## Inputs

The plan-guideline skill takes the following inputs:
- User's goal or requirement (either from conversation or a markdown file)
- Current codebase context (will be explored by the agent)
- Existing architecture patterns and conventions

## Planning Process

The AI agent **MUST** follow this systematic process when creating a plan:

### 1. Goal Understanding Phase

**Objective**: Deeply understand what the user wants to achieve.

Actions:
- Read and analyze the user's requirements thoroughly
- Identify the core problem or feature request
- Clarify ambiguous requirements using `AskUserQuestion` if needed
- Determine the scope: is this a new feature, bug fix, refactoring, or improvement?

Output signals:
- Clear problem statement in 1-2 sentences
- Success criteria (what does "done" look like?)
- Out of scope items (what are we explicitly NOT doing?)

**Bug Fix-Specific Actions (conditional):**

If the goal is a bug fix, attempt to reproduce the bug before designing a fix:

**When to reproduce:**
- Multi-file or unclear root cause bugs
- Behavior-related bugs (crashes, incorrect output, unexpected state)
- Bugs reported by users with reproduction steps

**When to skip reproduction:**
- Trivial single-file obvious fixes (e.g., typo, missing null check)
- Bug already has a failing test case demonstrating the issue
- Unsafe to run (e.g., requires production credentials, destructive commands)
- User has already provided complete reproduction details with diagnosis

**Reproduction process:**
1. Review reported symptoms and any provided reproduction steps
2. Identify minimal environment needed (files, dependencies, test data)
3. Attempt safe, read-only or isolated reproduction steps (e.g., run tests, review logs)
4. Document what was tried, what symptoms appeared, and environment snapshot
5. Form hypothesis about root cause based on observations
6. If unreproducible after reasonable attempts, document constraints and proceed with hypothesis

**Safety rules:**
- Only use read-only or safe commands (e.g., `cat`, `grep`, `git log`, `make test`)
- Never run destructive commands without explicit user permission
- Never access production systems or real user data
- Ask user before running any command that modifies state or requires credentials

**Output from reproduction (include in plan if attempted):**
- Steps tried (commands run, files examined)
- Observed symptoms (error messages, test failures, unexpected behavior)
- Minimal environment snapshot (relevant file state, dependencies, configuration)
- Root cause hypothesis based on observations
- If skipped, document explicit skip reason
- If unreproducible, document attempts and constraints

### 2. Codebase Audit Phase

**Objective**: Thoroughly explore the codebase to understand current implementation.

**CRITICAL**: The audit happens DURING planning, not as a step IN the plan.
The plan must contain audit RESULTS, not "TODO: audit the codebase" steps.

Actions:
- Use `Glob` to find relevant files by pattern
- Use `Grep` to search for related functionality
- Read existing implementations of similar features
- Identify architectural patterns and conventions
- Map out dependencies between modules

Output from this phase:
- List of files that will be modified (with line ranges if possible)
- List of files that will be created (with purpose)
- List of files that may be deleted
- Current architecture understanding

**Example of GOOD audit results in plan:**
```
Files to modify:
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:15-45` - Add milestone commit logic
- `tests/test_git_commit.sh:23-67` - Update test cases for milestones

Files to create:
- `docs/milestone-workflow.md` - Document milestone commit process
```

**Example of BAD (do not include this):**
```
1. Audit the codebase to find relevant files
2. Determine which files need changes
```

### 3. Interface Design Phase

**Objective**: Design the public interfaces, APIs, and documentation changes.

Actions:
- Design new function/class signatures
- Plan changes to existing interfaces (breaking vs. non-breaking)
- Identify documentation files that need updates
- Design configuration or input formats if applicable
- Consider backward compatibility

Output:
- New interfaces to be created (with signatures)
- Modified interfaces (showing before/after)
- Documentation structure (what goes in which doc file)
- Configuration schema if applicable

**Example:**
```
New interfaces:
- Function: `create_milestone_commit(files: list, message: str, test_status: str)`
- Config: Add `milestone.allow_no_verify` to project settings

Modified interfaces:
- Function: `git_commit()` - add optional parameter `is_milestone: bool = False`

Documentation updates:
- `docs/git-msg-tags.md:15-20` - Add milestone tag explanation
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:40-60` - Add milestone section
```

### 4. Test Strategy Design Phase

**Objective**: Design comprehensive test coverage before writing implementation code.

**CRITICAL**: Testing is not an afterthought. Design tests that validate:
- Happy path scenarios
- Edge cases and error conditions
- Integration with existing functionality
- Backward compatibility if applicable

**Bug fix-specific guidance:**
- If bug reproduction was attempted (see Goal Understanding Phase), translate reproduction steps into a failing test case when feasible
- Adopt fail-to-pass test thinking: reproduction → failing test → implementation → passing test
- If reproduction was unreproducible or skipped, document why a fail-to-pass test cannot be created

Actions:
- Identify existing test files that need updates
- Design new test files for new functionality
- Specify what each test validates
- Consider test data requirements
- Plan test execution order (unit -> integration -> e2e)
- For bug fixes: map reproduction steps to test cases where possible

Output:
- Test files to modify (with specific test cases to add/update)
- New test files to create (with purpose of each)
- Test data or fixtures needed
- Expected test coverage metrics

**Example:**
```
Test modifications:
- `tests/test_git_commit.sh:45-67` - Update to verify milestone flag handling
  - Test case: Verify `--no-verify` used only for milestone commits
  - Test case: Verify milestone commit message format

New test files:
- `tests/test_milestone_workflow.sh` - Test complete milestone workflow
  - Test case: Create milestone commit on dev branch (should succeed)
  - Test case: Attempt milestone commit on main (should fail)
  - Test case: Verify test status included in commit message
  - Estimated complexity: ~80 lines
```

### 5. Implementation Plan Phase

**Objective**: Create a step-by-step implementation plan with complexity estimates.

**CRITICAL**: Use lines of code (LOC) to estimate complexity, NOT time durations.

Complexity guidelines:
- Trivial: 1-20 LOC (simple config changes, single function additions)
- Small: 21-50 LOC (new function with basic logic, simple test cases)
- Medium: 51-150 LOC (new feature module, moderate refactoring)
- Large: 151-400 LOC (significant feature, multiple file changes)
- Very large: 401+ LOC (major refactoring, new subsystem)

**MANDATORY ORDERING**: Implementation steps **MUST** follow this sequence:

**Phase 1: Documentation (always first)**
- Which documentation files should be changed, created, or deleted.
- Include the specific changes to make in the plan so that we can better understand:
  - 1. The scope of changes of this plan
  - 2. The specific design decisions to be applied
- The old ones should include the file name and the sections. **DO NOT** include the line numbers as multiple changes may be ongoing, which leads to different line numbers.
- The new ones should include the specific description of what to add, not just vague "add documentation for X".
  - **DO NOT**: Update the documentation of `lol` usage.
  - **DO**: In `docs/lol.md` the old usage is in Section X, update it to the new usage for `--init` is for initialization and `--update` is for updating existing installations.
- Documentation change should include both specific source files and high-level design documents.
- If it is a user-exposed interfaces, update usage examples.

**Phase 2: Test Cases (always second)**
- Create new test files
- Update existing test cases
- Add test fixtures/data
- Document test scenarios
- Make a correspondence to the documentation and interface changes from previous phases

**Phase 3: Implementation (always last)**
- Write the actual code
- Implement the logic
- Integrate with existing code
- Make a correspondence to the documentation and test cases from previous phases

Actions:
- **NEVER** put implementation before documentation or tests
- **NEVER** fuse multiple steps into one:
  - **DO NOT**: Step 3-5: Implement feature X (Estimated: 300 LOC)
  - **DO**: Step 3: Implement part A of feature X (Estimated: 35 LOC)
            Step 4: Implement part B of feature X (Estimated: 63 LOC)
            Step 5: Implement part C of feature X (Estimated: 111 LOC)
- Group documentation updates into Step 1 (or Steps 1-N for large features)
- Group test case work into the next step(s)
- For each step, specify:
  - Exact files to change with specific sections and lines!
  - What changes to make
  - Estimated lines of code
  - Dependencies on previous steps
  - What the step accomplishes toward the goal
- Break down steps larger than 400 LOC into substeps
- Consider milestone commits for features beyond 800 LOC total

**Understanding Milestone Commits:**

Milestone commits are for incremental progress on large features. They allow bypassing
pre-commit hooks, but this does NOT mean skipping tests:

- **Tests are ALWAYS run** - even for milestone commits
- **Temporarily accept incomplete test passage** - e.g., "35/42 tests passed"
- **Track progress mile-by-mile** - each milestone shows test progress
- **Work toward full passage** - continue until all tests pass
- **Only merge when complete** - all tests must pass before merging to main

Example milestone progression:
- Milestone 1: Documentation complete, tests created (0/8 tests pass)
- Milestone 2: Basic implementation (3/8 tests pass)
- Milestone 3: Edge cases handled (6/8 tests pass)
- Delivery commit: All tests pass (8/8), ready to merge

Output format:
```
Step N: [Brief description] (Estimated: X LOC)
- File 1: Specific change description
- File 2: Specific change description
Dependencies: [List steps that must complete first]
```

**Example (following Design-first TDD ordering):**
```
Step 1: Update documentation for milestone commits (Estimated: 60 LOC)
- `docs/git-msg-tags.md:15-20` - Add milestone tag definition and usage
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:14-20` - Add milestone to inputs section
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:40-60` - Add milestone commit section with examples
Dependencies: None

Step 2: Create test cases for milestone functionality (Estimated: 90 LOC)
- `tests/test_git_commit.sh:45-67` - Add milestone flag tests
  - Test: Verify `--no-verify` used only for milestone commits
  - Test: Verify milestone commit message format
- `tests/test_milestone_message.sh` - New test file for message validation
  - Test: Validate milestone commit on dev branch succeeds
  - Test: Validate milestone commit on main fails
Dependencies: Step 1 (documentation must be complete first)

Step 3: Implement milestone detection and handling logic (Estimated: 100 LOC)
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:25-35` - Add milestone input handling
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:85-88` - Add pre-commit bypass logic
Dependencies: Step 2 (tests must exist before implementation)

Total estimated complexity: 250 LOC (Medium-Large feature)
Recommended approach: Implement in single development session
Note: Follows Design-first TDD: Docs (Step 1) → Tests (Step 2) → Implementation (Step 3)
```

```

## Integration with Other Skills

After creating a plan, the AI agent should:

1. **Present to user for approval**
   - Display the complete plan
   - Ask for confirmation or revisions

2. **Create GitHub issue** (once approved)
   - Use the `open-issue` skill
   - The plan becomes the "Proposed Solution" section
   - Add appropriate `[plan][tag]` prefix

3. **Begin implementation** (after issue created)
   - Use the `fork-dev-branch` skill to create a development branch
   - Follow the step-by-step plan
   - Use `commit-msg` skill for commits (milestone commits if needed)
   - Use `open-pr` skill when implementation is complete

## Examples

### Example 1: Small Feature Addition

**User request:** "Add support for milestone commits in the commit-msg skill"

**Plan excerpt:**
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: Milestone Commit Support

## Goal
Add milestone commit functionality to allow work-in-progress commits that can
bypass pre-commit hooks on development branches.

**Success criteria:**
- Milestone commits work only on development branches (not main)
- Milestone commits include test status in message
- Pre-commit hooks can be bypassed with explicit milestone flag

**Out of scope:**
- Automatic milestone detection
- Milestone progress tracking UI

## Codebase Analysis

- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:40-88` - Add milestone message format
- `tests/test_git_commit.sh:45-67` - Add milestone tests

**Files to create:**
- None required

**Current architecture notes:**
- Commit skill currently supports only delivery commits
- Pre-commit hook validation is mandatory for all commits
- Branch detection logic already exists in workflow

## Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Update documentation** (Estimated: 60 LOC)
- `docs/git-msg-tags.md:15-20` - Add milestone tag definition and usage rules
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:14-20` - Add milestone to inputs section
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:40-60` - Add milestone message format section
Dependencies: None

**Step 2: Create test cases** (Estimated: 85 LOC)
- `tests/test_git_commit.sh:45-67` - Add milestone-specific tests
  - Test: Milestone commits bypass hooks on dev branches
  - Test: Milestone commits fail on main branch
  - Test: Milestone message includes test status
- `tests/test_milestone_format.sh` - New test for message validation
Dependencies: Step 1 (documentation must define behavior first)

**Step 3: Implement milestone commit logic** (Estimated: 95 LOC)
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:25-35` - Add milestone input processing
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:85-88` - Add pre-commit bypass logic
Dependencies: Step 2 (tests must exist to validate implementation)

**Total estimated complexity:** 240 LOC (Medium feature)
**Recommended approach:** Single development session following Docs → Tests → Implementation
```

### Example 2: Large Refactoring

**User request:** "Refactor the SDK initialization to validate directories"

**Plan excerpt:**
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: SDK Init Directory Validation

## Goal
Add comprehensive directory validation to SDK initialization to prevent
initialization in invalid locations and provide clear error messages.

**Success criteria:**
- Validate target directory exists and is writable
- Check for conflicting files before initialization
- Provide actionable error messages
- Support both init and update modes

**Out of scope:**
- Automatic directory creation
- Backup/rollback functionality

## Codebase Analysis

**Files to modify:**
- `Makefile:45-67` - Add validation before template copying
- `docs/lol.md:25-40` - Document validation behavior

**Files to create:**
- `scripts/validate_target_dir.sh` - Directory validation logic (Est: 120 LOC)
- `tests/test_directory_validation.sh` - Validation tests (Est: 180 LOC)

## Test Strategy

**New test files:**
- `tests/test_directory_validation.sh` (Estimated: 180 LOC)
  - Test case: Valid empty directory (should pass)
  - Test case: Non-existent directory (should fail with error)
  - Test case: Directory with conflicting files (should fail with list)
  - Test case: Non-writable directory (should fail with permission error)
  - Test case: Init mode vs update mode differences

## Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Update documentation** (Estimated: 60 LOC)
- `docs/lol.md:25-40` - Document validation behavior and error messages
- `docs/lol.md:50-65` - Add examples of valid/invalid target directories
Dependencies: None

**Step 2: Create test cases** (Estimated: 180 LOC)
- `tests/test_directory_validation.sh` - New comprehensive validation test suite
  - Test: Valid empty directory initialization
  - Test: Non-existent directory rejection
  - Test: Conflicting files detection
  - Test: Permission error handling
  - Test: Init vs update mode differences
Dependencies: Step 1 (documentation defines expected behavior)

**Step 3: Implement validation script** (Estimated: 120 LOC)
- `scripts/validate_target_dir.sh` - New validation script with all checks
  - Directory existence check
  - Write permission validation
  - Conflict detection logic
  - Mode-specific validation rules
Dependencies: Step 2 (tests define all edge cases)

**Step 4: Integrate validation into Makefile** (Estimated: 60 LOC)
- `Makefile:45-67` - Add validation call before template copying
- `Makefile:70-85` - Add error handling and user feedback
Dependencies: Step 3 (validation script must exist)

**Total estimated complexity:** 420 LOC (Large feature)
**Recommended approach:** Use milestone commits for incremental progress

**Milestone strategy:**
- Milestone 1 (after Step 2): Documentation and tests complete (0/5 tests pass)
  - All tests exist but implementation not started yet
- Milestone 2 (after Step 3): Validation script implemented (3/5 tests pass)
  - Basic validation working, edge cases still failing
- Delivery commit (after Step 4): Full integration complete (5/5 tests pass)
  - All tests pass, ready for PR

**Note:** Follows Design-first TDD strictly: Docs (Step 1) → Tests (Step 2) → Implementation (Steps 3-4)
Tests are run at each milestone; failing tests are accepted temporarily as progress checkpoints.
```

### Example 3: Bug Fix with Reproduction

**User request:** "Fix the bug where milestone commits fail on feature branches"

**Plan excerpt:**
```markdown
# Implementation Plan: Fix Milestone Commit Branch Detection

## Goal
Fix bug where milestone commits incorrectly fail on valid feature branches due to
overly strict branch name pattern matching.

**Success criteria:**
- Milestone commits succeed on all non-main branches
- Branch name pattern accepts common formats (issue-*, feature/*, fix/*)
- Clear error message when attempted on main/master

## Bug Reproduction

**Steps tried:**
1. Created test branch: `git checkout -b issue-42-test-feature`
2. Attempted milestone commit: `claude /commit-msg milestone`
3. Observed error: "Milestone commits only allowed on development branches"

**Observed symptoms:**
- Error appears despite being on `issue-42-test-feature` branch
- Review of `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:78` shows pattern: `^issue-[0-9]+-.*$`
- Regex escaping issue: dash not escaped, matches any character instead of literal dash

**Environment snapshot:**
- Git branch: `issue-42-test-feature`
- Skill version: commit `a1b2c3d` (2024-01-15)
- Regex engine: bash `[[ =~ ]]` operator

**Root cause hypothesis:**
Unescaped dash in regex pattern causes false negative matches. Pattern should be
`^issue-[0-9]+-.*$` with escaped dash: `^issue-[0-9]+\-.*$`.

## Implementation Steps

**Step 1: Update documentation** (Estimated: 20 LOC)
- `docs/git-msg-tags.md:45-50` - Clarify supported branch name patterns
Dependencies: None

**Step 2: Create test case** (Estimated: 35 LOC)
- `tests/test_milestone_branches.sh` - New test for branch pattern matching
  - Test: `issue-N-*` branches accept milestone commits
  - Test: `feature/*` branches accept milestone commits
  - Test: `main` branch rejects milestone commits
Dependencies: Step 1

**Step 3: Fix regex pattern** (Estimated: 15 LOC)
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:78` - Escape dash in regex pattern
- `.claude/skills/commit-msg/SKILL.md:80` - Add `feature/*` and `fix/*` patterns
Dependencies: Step 2

**Total estimated complexity:** 70 LOC (Small bugfix)
```

## Validation Checklist

Use this checklist to validate plan quality before presenting to user:

**Required elements:**
- [ ] Goal statement is 1-2 sentences, clear and specific
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable and testable
- [ ] Out of scope items are explicitly listed
- [ ] All file paths include line ranges (where known)
- [ ] LOC estimates provided for each step
- [ ] Steps follow strict ordering: Docs → Tests → Implementation
- [ ] Dependencies enforce the correct ordering
- [ ] Test strategy includes specific test cases with descriptions
- [ ] Total complexity estimate is provided

**Bug fix plans only:**
- [ ] Bug reproduction attempted or skip reason documented
- [ ] Reproduction includes steps tried and symptoms observed
- [ ] Root cause hypothesis is stated based on observations
- [ ] If unreproducible, constraints and limitations documented

**Quality checks:**
- [ ] No vague "audit the codebase" steps (audit results included instead)
- [ ] Implementation does not appear before documentation or tests
- [ ] File paths are concrete, not generic placeholders
- [ ] Test cases validate the actual success criteria
- [ ] Complexity estimates are realistic (compare to similar past changes)

## Important Notes

1. **MANDATORY ordering - Design-first TDD**: Implementation steps **MUST** follow this order:
   - Step 1 (or Steps 1-N): Documentation updates
   - Step 2 (or Steps N+1-M): Test case creation/updates
   - Step 3+ (or Steps M+1-end): Implementation code

   **NEVER** put implementation before documentation or tests. This is non-negotiable.

2. **No vague audit steps**: The plan must contain concrete file names and line ranges,
   not "audit the codebase" tasks. Auditing happens during planning.

3. **Quantify with LOC**: Always use lines of code estimates, never time-based estimates
   like "2 hours" or "3 days".

4. **Test-first mindset**: Design tests before implementation details. Tests clarify
   requirements and prevent scope creep. Tests must exist before writing implementation.

5. **Break down large steps**: If a single step exceeds 400 LOC, break it into substeps.
   Consider milestone commits for features exceeding 800 LOC total.

6. **Document interfaces early**: Interface design comes before implementation planning.
   Changes to interfaces affect multiple files and should be designed carefully.

7. **Use existing patterns**: During audit, identify and follow existing architectural
   patterns and naming conventions in the codebase.

8. **Be specific**: Prefer "Modify `file.py:45-67` to add parameter validation" over
   "Update the validation logic". The more specific, the better.

9. **Dependencies reflect ordering**: Each step's dependencies should enforce the ordering:
   - Tests depend on documentation
   - Implementation depends on tests
   - Never skip the dependency chain

10. **Milestone commits run tests**: When planning features that require milestone commits:
    - Tests are ALWAYS run at each milestone (not skipped)
    - Bypassing pre-commit hooks means accepting incomplete test passage temporarily
    - Each milestone must report test status (e.g., "15/20 tests passed")
    - Work incrementally until all tests pass
    - Only merge to main when all tests pass (100% passage required)
