# Commands

This directory contains command definitions for Claude Code. Commands are shortcuts that can be invoked to execute specific workflows or skills.

## Purpose

## Organization

- Each command is defined in its own `.md` file
- Command files include:
  - `name`: The command name (used for invocation)
  - `description`: Brief description of what the command does
  - Instructions on how to use the command and which skills it invokes

## Available Commands

- `agent-review.md`: Review code changes via agent with isolated context and Opus model
- `code-review.md`: Review code changes from current HEAD to main/HEAD following review standards
- `git-commit.md`: Invokes the commit-msg skill to create commits with meaningful messages following project standards
