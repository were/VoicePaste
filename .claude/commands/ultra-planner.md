# Ultra Planner Command

**IMPORTANT**: Keep a correct mindset when this command is invoked.

0. This workflow is intended to be as hands-off as possible, do your best
  - NOT TO STOP until the plan is finalized
  - NOT TO ask user for design decisions. Choose the one you think the most reasonable.
    If it is bad plan, user will feed it later.

1. This is a **planning tool only**. It takes a feature description as input and produces
a consensus implementation plan as output. It does NOT make any code changes or implement features.
Even if user is telling you "build...", "add...", "create...", "implement...", or "fix...",
you must interpret these as making a plan for how to have these achieved, not actually doing them!
  - **DO NOT** make any changes to the codebase!

2. This command uses a **multi-agent debate system** to generate high-quality plans.
**No matter** how simple you think the request is, always strictly follow the multi-agent
debase workflow below to do a thorough analysis of the request throughout the whole code base.
Sometimes what seems simple at first may have hidden complexities or breaking changes that
need to be uncovered via a debate and thorough codebase analysis.
  - **DO** follow the following multi-agent debate workflow exactly as specified.

Create implementation plans through multi-agent debate, combining innovation, critical analysis,
and simplification into a balanced consensus plan.

Invoke the command: `/ultra-planner [feature-description]` or `/ultra-planner --refine [issue-no] [refine-comments]`

## What This Command Does

This command orchestrates a multi-agent debate system to generate high-quality implementation plans:

1. **Context gathering**: Launch understander agent to gather codebase context
2. **Three-agent debate**: Launch bold-proposer (with context) first, then critique and reducer analyze its output
3. **Combine reports**: Merge all three perspectives into single document
4. **External consensus**: Invoke external-consensus skill to synthesize balanced plan
5. **Draft issue creation**: Automatically create draft GitHub issue via open-issue skill

## Inputs

**This command only accepts feature descriptions for planning purposes. It does not execute implementation.**

**From arguments ($ARGUMENTS):**

- To avoid expanding ARGUMENTS multiple times, later we will use `{FEATURE_DESC}` to refer to it.

**Default mode:**
```
/ultra-planner Add user authentication with JWT tokens and role-based access control
```

**Refinement mode:**

```
/ultra-planner --refine <issue-no> <description>
```
- Refines an existing plan by running it through the debate system again

**From conversation context:**
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is empty, extract feature description from recent messages
- Look for: "implement...", "add...", "create...", "build..." statements

## Outputs

**This command produces planning documents only. No code changes are made.**

**Files created:**
- `.tmp/issue-[refine-]{N}-context.md` - Understander context summary
- `.tmp/issue-[refine-]{N}-bold.md` - Bold proposer agent report
- `.tmp/issue-[refine-]{N}-critique.md` - Critique agent report
- `.tmp/issue-[refine-]{N}-reducer.md` - Reducer agent report
- `.tmp/issue-[refine-]{N}-debate.md` - Combined three-agent report
- `.tmp/issue-[refine-]{N}-consensus.md` - Final balanced plan

`[refine-]` is optional for refine mode.

**GitHub issue:**
- Created via open-issue skill if user approves

**Terminal output:**
- Debate summary from all three agents
- Consensus plan summary
- GitHub issue URL (if created)

## Workflow

### Step 1: Parse Arguments and Extract Feature Description

Accept the $ARGUMENTS.

If we have `--refine` at the beginning, the next number is the issue number to be refined,
and the rest are issue refine comments.
You should fetch the issue to incoperate the users comments.
```bash
git issue view <issue-no>
```

### Step 2: Validate Feature Description

Ensure feature description is clear and complete:

**Check:**
- Non-empty (minimum 10 characters)
- Describes what to build (not just "add feature")
- Provides enough context for agents to analyze

**If unclear:**
```
The feature description is unclear or too brief.

Current description: {description}

Please provide more details:
- What functionality are you adding?
- What problem does it solve?
- Any specific requirements or constraints?
```

Ask user for clarification.

### Step 3: Create Placeholder Issue

**REQUIRED SKILL CALL (before agent execution):**

Create a placeholder issue to obtain the issue number for artifact naming:

```
Skill tool parameters:
  skill: "open-issue"
  args: "--auto"
```

**Provide context to open-issue skill:**
- Feature description: `FEATURE_DESC`
- Issue body: "Placeholder for multi-agent planning in progress. This will be updated with the consensus plan."

**Extract issue number from response:**
```bash
# Expected output: "GitHub issue created: #42"
ISSUE_URL=$(echo "$OPEN_ISSUE_OUTPUT" | grep -o 'https://[^ ]*')
ISSUE_NUMBER=$(echo "$ISSUE_URL" | grep -o '[0-9]*$')
```

**Use `ISSUE_NUMBER` for all artifact filenames going forward** (Steps 4-8).

**Error handling:**
- If placeholder creation fails, stop execution and report error (cannot proceed without issue number)

### Step 4: Invoke Understander Agent

**REQUIRED TOOL CALL (before Bold-Proposer):**

Use the Task tool to launch the understander agent to gather codebase context:

```
Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: "understander"
  prompt: "Gather codebase context for the following feature request: {FEATURE_DESC}"
  description: "Gather codebase context"
  model: "sonnet"
```

**Wait for agent completion** (blocking operation, do not proceed to Step 5 until done).

**Extract output:**
- Generate filename: `CONTEXT_FILE=".tmp/issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}-context.md"`
- Save the agent's full response to `$CONTEXT_FILE`
- Also store in variable `UNDERSTANDER_OUTPUT` for passing to Bold-proposer in Step 5

### Step 5: Invoke Bold-Proposer Agent

**REQUIRED TOOL CALL #1:**

Use the Task tool to launch the bold-proposer agent with understander context:

```
Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: "bold-proposer"
  prompt: "Research and propose an innovative solution for: {FEATURE_DESC}

CODEBASE CONTEXT (from understander):
{UNDERSTANDER_OUTPUT}

Use this context as your starting point for understanding the codebase.
Focus your exploration on SOTA research and innovation."
  description: "Research SOTA solutions"
  model: "opus"
```

**Wait for agent completion** (blocking operation, do not proceed to Step 6 until done).

**Extract output:**
- Generate filename: `BOLD_FILE=".tmp/issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}-bold-proposal.md"`
- Save the agent's full response to `$BOLD_FILE`
- Also store in variable `BOLD_PROPOSAL` for passing to critique and reducer agents in Step 6

### Step 6: Invoke Critique and Reducer Agents

**REQUIRED TOOL CALLS #2 & #3:**

**CRITICAL**: Launch BOTH agents in a SINGLE message with TWO Task tool calls to ensure parallel execution.

**Task tool call #1 - Critique Agent:**
```
Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: "proposal-critique"
  prompt: "Analyze the following proposal for feasibility and risks:

Feature: {FEATURE_DESC}

Proposal from Bold-Proposer:
{BOLD_PROPOSAL}

Provide critical analysis of assumptions, risks, and feasibility."
  description: "Critique bold proposal"
  model: "opus"
```

**Task tool call #2 - Reducer Agent:**
```
Task tool parameters:
  subagent_type: "proposal-reducer"
  prompt: "Simplify the following proposal using 'less is more' philosophy:

Feature: {FEATURE_DESC}

Proposal from Bold-Proposer:
{BOLD_PROPOSAL}

Identify unnecessary complexity and propose simpler alternatives."
  description: "Simplify bold proposal"
  model: "opus"
```

**Wait for both agents to complete** (blocking operation).

**Extract outputs:**
- Generate filename: `CRITIQUE_FILE=".tmp/issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}-critique.md"`
- Save critique agent's response to `$CRITIQUE_FILE`
- Generate filename: `REDUCER_FILE=".tmp/issue-${ISSUE_NUMBER}-reducer.md"`
- Save reducer agent's response to `$REDUCER_FILE`

**Expected agent outputs:**
- Bold proposer: Innovative proposal with SOTA research
- Critique: Risk analysis and feasibility assessment of Bold's proposal
- Reducer: Simplified version of Bold's proposal with complexity analysis

### Step 7: Invoke External Consensus Skill

**REQUIRED SKILL CALL:**

Use the Skill tool to invoke the external-consensus skill with the 3 report file paths:

```
Skill tool parameters:
  skill: "external-consensus"
  args: "{BOLD_FILE} {CRITIQUE_FILE} {REDUCER_FILE}"
```

**Note:** The external-consensus skill will:
1. Combine the 3 agent reports into a single debate report (saved as `.tmp/issue-{N}-debate.md`)
2. Process the combined report through external AI review (Codex or Claude Opus)

NOTE: This consensus synthesis can take long time depending on the complexity of the debate report.
Give it 30 minutes timeout to complete, which is mandatory for **ALL DEBATES**!

**What this skill does:**
1. Combines the 3 agent reports into a single debate report (saved as `.tmp/issue-{N}-debate.md`)
2. Prepares external review prompt using `.claude/skills/external-consensus/external-review-prompt.md`
3. Invokes Codex CLI (preferred) or Claude API (fallback) for consensus synthesis
4. Parses and validates the consensus plan structure
5. Saves consensus plan to `.tmp/issue-{N}-consensus.md`
6. Returns summary and file path

**Expected output structure from skill:**
```
External consensus review complete!

Consensus Plan Summary:
- Feature: {feature_name}
- Total LOC: ~{N} ({complexity})
- Components: {count}
- Critical risks: {risk_count}

Key Decisions:
- From Bold Proposal: {accepted_innovations}
- From Critique: {risks_addressed}
- From Reducer: {simplifications_applied}

Consensus plan saved to: {CONSENSUS_PLAN_FILE}
```

**Extract:**
- Save the consensus plan file path as `CONSENSUS_PLAN_FILE`

### Step 8: Update Placeholder Issue with Consensus Plan

**REQUIRED SKILL CALL:**

Use the Skill tool to invoke the open-issue skill with update and auto flags:

```
Skill tool parameters:
  skill: "open-issue"
  args: "--update ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --auto {CONSENSUS_PLAN_FILE}"
```

**What this skill does:**
1. Reads consensus plan from file
2. Determines appropriate tag from `docs/git-msg-tags.md`
3. Formats issue with `[plan]` prefix and Problem Statement/Proposed Solution sections
4. Updates existing issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER} (created in Step 3) using `gh issue edit`
5. Returns issue number and URL

**Expected output:**
```
Plan issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER} updated with consensus plan.

Title: [plan][tag] {feature name}
URL: {issue_url}

To refine: /ultra-planner --refine ${ISSUE_NUMBER}
To implement: /issue-to-impl ${ISSUE_NUMBER}
```

### Step 9: Add "agentize:plan" Label to Finalize Issue

**REQUIRED BASH COMMAND:**

Add the "agentize:plan" label to mark the issue as a finalized plan:

```bash
gh issue edit ${ISSUE_NUMBER} --add-label "agentize:plan"
```

**What this does:**
1. Adds "agentize:plan" label to the issue (creates label if it doesn't exist)
2. Triggers hands-off state machine transition to `done` state
3. Marks the issue as ready for review/implementation

**Expected output:**
```
Label "agentize:plan" added to issue #${ISSUE_NUMBER}
```

Display the final output to the user. Command completes successfully.
